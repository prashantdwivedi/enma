Fish shell prompt use [fishshell.com](https://fishshell.com/) and the theme is [Tomorrow Night](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/) or [draculatheme.com](https://draculatheme.com/). But I use other theme and do some my own customisation.

### Tabs in left panel

To change the tabs to be located at left, just go to `iTerm > Preferences > Appearance` there, in `General` you will see `Tab bar location`, set that to `Left`

You also can customize the icon and session title, to do that, simple go to `iTerm > Preferences > Profiles`, `General` and in `Basics` section going to see the `Icon` and `Title` inputs.

### Status bar

This is a new super cool ui improvement of iTerm, to enabled it go to `iTerm > Preferences > Profiles` then in the left sub sections go to `Session`. There at the bottom, you will find the enabled check and the configuration link, where you can customize which components put on your bar. It's simple just drag and drop the components.
