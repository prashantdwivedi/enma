# How to fix a locale setting warning from Perl

Last Update August 13, 2022 
---
```bash title="error like that"
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
    LANGUAGE = (unset),
    LC_ALL = (unset),
    LANG = "en_GB.UTF-8"
are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
```

Few command to fix that issue:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/locale
```

The original file looks like this:

```bash
File generated by update-locale
LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
```

Find your use that link â†’ [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/E26033/glset.html](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/E26033/glset.html) and add a couple of lines at the end, so it looks like this:

```bash
#examples below
File generated by update-locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

Save and reboot. Problem solved!
